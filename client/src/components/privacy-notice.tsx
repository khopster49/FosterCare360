              <li>for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest;</li>
              <li>for the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a relevant third party (such as a benefits provider), but only if these are not overridden by your interests, rights or freedoms;</li>
              <li>because it is necessary for carrying out obligations or exercising rights in employment law;</li>
              <li>(i.e. equality of opportunity or treatment, promoting or retaining racial and ethnic diversity at senior level, preventing or detecting unlawful acts); and</li>
              <li>to establish, exercise and/or defend any legal claims that may be brought by or against us in connection with your recruitment.</li>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-orange-500 my-4">How we may share the information.</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We may also need to share some of the above categories of personal information with other parties, such as HR consultants and professional advisers. Usually, information will be anonymised but this may not always be possible. The recipient of the information will be bound by confidentiality obligations. We may also be required to share some personal information with our regulators or as required to comply with the law.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-orange-500 my-4">Sensitive personal information and criminal records information.</h2>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-orange-500 my-4">How long we keep your information.</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We keep the personal information that we obtain about you during the recruitment process for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. How long we keep your information will depend on whether your application is successful and you become employed by us, the nature of the information concerned and the purposes for which it is processed.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We will keep recruitment information (including interview notes) for no longer than is reasonable, taking into account the limitation periods for potential claims such as race or sex discrimination (as extended to take account of early conciliation), after which they will be destroyed. If there is a clear business reason for keeping recruitment records for longer than the recruitment period, we may do so, but will first consider whether the records can be pseudonymised, and the longer period for which they will be kept.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              If your application is successful, we will keep only the recruitment information that is necessary in relation to your employment. For further information, please see our GDPR Data Protection Policy and GDPR Data Retention Policy.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Further details on our approach to information retention and destruction are available in our GDPR Data Protection Policy.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-orange-500 my-4">Your right to object to us processing your information.</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Where our processing of your information is based solely on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), you have the right to object to that processing if you give us specific reasons as to why you are objecting, which are based on your particular situation. If you object, we can no longer process your information unless we can demonstrate legitimate grounds for the processing, which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.
